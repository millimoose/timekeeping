# timekeeping

Older utility for scraping iCal events into a report I can use to fill a
timesheet. Doesn't really follow modern best practices, it uses a library that's
no longer available for 3.x, and this was before I believed in writing a
docstring before the code.

## ToDo

* Convert to Python 3
* 100% test coverage
* Refactor to microservices
* None of the above
